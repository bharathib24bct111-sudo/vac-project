🚀 Intrusion / Spam Detection Using Machine Learning (TF-IDF + NB / Logistic Regression)

This project builds a machine learning classifier to detect malicious or unwanted entries from a mixed-type dataset.
The pipeline automatically adapts to CSV files containing text, numerical, or mixed features, performs preprocessing, trains a model, and evaluates performance using multiple metrics and visualizations.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a flexible ML pipeline that:

Loads any uploaded dataset (CSV)

Automatically identifies text columns and numeric columns

Applies:

TF-IDF vectorization for text features

Standard scaling for numeric features

Trains a suitable model:

Complement Naive Bayes for text-only datasets

Logistic Regression for mixed-feature datasets

Produces detailed evaluation metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report

ROC Curve (Binary or Multiclass)

The entire workflow is implemented inside Google Colab so anyone can run it easily.

🧩 Dataset Description

The script accepts any dataset containing a label column named:

Label, label, target, class, or Class


The rest of the columns are treated as features.

✔ Supported Feature Types
Feature Type	Handling Method
Text (string/object)	TF-IDF vectorization
Numeric	StandardScaler
Mixed	ColumnTransformer (TF-IDF + Scaling)
No text columns	Converts whole row into a text string
⚙️ Machine Learning Pipeline
1️⃣ Data Loading
uploaded = files.upload()
df = pd.read_csv(file_name)

2️⃣ Label Detection

Auto-detects the label column and separates features (X) and labels (y).

3️⃣ Automatic Feature Type Identification

Extracts text columns

Extracts numeric columns

If no text column exists → Concatenates entire row as text

4️⃣ Model Selection
Dataset Type	Model Used
Text-only	Complement Naive Bayes
Mixed (text + numeric)	Logistic Regression
5️⃣ Model Training

Pipeline built using:

TfidfVectorizer

StandardScaler

ColumnTransformer

Pipeline

6️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix (heatmap)

ROC Curve (binary)

Multiclass ROC (One-vs-Rest)

📊 Visualizations
✔ Confusion Matrix

Automatically plots a labeled heatmap showing predictions vs ground truth.

✔ Class Distribution

Shows the count of each class before training.

✔ ROC / AUC

Binary → Standard ROC curve

Multiclass → One-vs-Rest ROC curves
